        <p>
            In 1911 a breed club was formed for the breed in England, the Golden Retriever Club, and they were given a new name, the 'Yellow or Golden Retriever'; from this point they were increasingly seen as a separate breed from the Flat-coated Retriever.
            The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is a working dog, and registration is subject to successful completion of a working trial.

            Golden Retrievers generally have a sweet-natured temperament; they are often friendly dogs that get along with children, other pets, and even strangers. They enjoy being the center of attention and being petted. In fact, Goldens will often nudge you gently so that you continue to pet them.
