            Labradors are playful and intelligent, with a warm, friendly temperament that makes them ideal for first-time owners. Labradors are easy-going, rewarding pets with high energy levels, meaning they love extra attention and exercise.
            They're highly affectionate, easily trainable, aim to please, and love to play. However, as extremely loving people-pleasers, Labs tend to have a high demand for attention and physical contact, which may be problematic for some if left alone for extended periods of time.
